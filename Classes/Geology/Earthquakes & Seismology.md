# Earthquakes 
- Shaking caused by a rapid release of energy
	- Energy moves outward as expanding sphere of waves
- Earthquakes are common on this planet
	- They occur every day


### What Causes Earthquakes
- **Hypocenter (focus)** - the place where the fault slip occurs
	- Usually occurs on a fault surface
	- Earthquake waves expand outward from the [[hypocenter]]
- **Epicenter** - land surface right above the [[hypocenter]]
	- Maps often portray the location of epicenters
- **Seismicity** (earthquake activity) occurs due to:
	- Sudden motion along a newly formed crustal fault
	- Sudden slip along an existing fault
	- A sudden change in mineral structure
	- Movement of magma in a volcano
	- Volcanic Eruption
	- Giant landslides
	- Meteorite impacts
	- Nuclear detonations
- Fault slip is the most common

## Seismic Waves
- **Body Waves** - pass through Earth's interior
	- **P-waves (primary or compressional waves)** 
		- waves travel by compressing and expanding material
		- Material moves back and forth parallel to wave direction
		- P-waves are the fastest
		- They travel through solids, liquids, and gases
	- **S-waves (secondary or shear waves)**
		- Waves travel by moving material back and forth
		- Material moves perpendicular to wave travel direction
		- S-waves are slower than P-waves

- **Surface Waves** - travel along Earth's exterior
	Surface waves are the slowest and most destructive
	- **L-waves (love waves)
	- **R-waves (Rayleigh waves)
		- P-waves that intersect the land surface
		- Cause the ground to ripple up and down like water
	
P-wave turns into L waves and S wave turn into R waves

##### How do we measure Earthquakes
- **Seismometer** - instrument that records ground motion
	- ...
- **Seismogram** - data recording earthquake wave behavior
	- Earthquake waves arrive at a station in specific order
		- P-waves first
		- S-waves second
		- Surface waves last
	- Arrival times determine the distance to the epicenter

## Finding the Epicenter
- P-waves always arrive first; then S-waves
	- P-wave and S-wave arrivals are separated in time
	- Separation grows with distance from the epicenter
	- The time delay is used to establish this distance

- Data from three or more stations pinpoints the epicenter
	- The distance radius from each station is drawn on a map
	- Circles around three or more stations 

### Earthquake Size
- **Magnitude** - a uniform measurement of size
	- The maximum amplitude of ground motion
	- Several magnitude scales are used
		- **Richter Scale** - useful near the epicenter
		- **Moment Magnitude Scale** - most accurate measure
- Magnitude scales are logarithmic
	- M6.0 is ten times an M5.0
	- M7.0 is a thousand times an M4.0

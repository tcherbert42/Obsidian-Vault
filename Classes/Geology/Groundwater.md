## There are 5 processes involved in the **hydrologic cycle**
- Evaporation/Transpiration
- Condensation
- Precipitation
- Infiltration
- Runoff
A study of **groundwater** deals with the infiltration portion of the cycle

### Groundwater Concepts
Two things are required for rock and sediment to contain ground water:
1) Pore Space (**porosity**)
	- Greater pore space = more room for water to be stored 
2) Passage ways connecting the pore spaces (**permeability**)
	- Higher permeability = higher rate of water moving freely through 

# Groundwater
- **Groundwater** is the water that occurs beneath the surface of the earth in the Zone of Saturation 
- The top of the zone of saturation is referred to as the **Water Table**
- Groundwater originates from participation which percolates downward through the porous **Vadose Zone** until it reaches the water table. 

#### Groundwater Movement and Shape of the Water Table
- Usually parallels topography
- Groundwater flows down slope
- No slope - no flow

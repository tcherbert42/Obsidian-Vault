# [[Igneous]] Rocks
- [[Igneous]] comes from the greek word for fire!
- Rock - a solid aggregate of geologic materials
- Geologic Materials Include: mostly mineral crystals | May include non-mineral solids like glass & other broken rock fragments, & fossils. 
- 3 types of rock: [[Igneous]], [[Sedimentary - Rocks & Basins]], and [[Metamorphic]]

### [[Igneous]] Rock Environments: Case Studies
- Rock-Melt -> Igneous Rock
	- Produced (or crystallizes) from cooling of hot rock-melts
	- Melts may be inside the Earth or on Earth's surface
	- As a hot rock-melt cools, different minerals crystallize that make up a solid [[Igneous]] rock

# Magma vs Lava
- [[Igneous]] Rock-Melts are of 2 types: [[magma]] & [[Lava]]
- [[magma]]: Hot molten rock material deep inside the Earth
	- Cools to [[Intrusive Igneous Rocks]]
- [[Lava]]: If the hot molten rock material find its way to the Earth's surface
	- Cools to [[Extrusive Igneous Rocks]]
- Smaller extrusive crystals cool faster 

## Extrusive Igneous Rocks
- Cool fast from [[Lava]] on the Earth's surface
	- have [[Aphanitic]] Texture (or fine-grained mineral crystals)
	- Ex: Basalt, 

## Intrusive Igneous Rocks
- Cools slow from [[magma]] under the Earth's surface

### Aphanitic
- (Fine-grained): Individual minerals NOT seen with the naked eyes. Microscope needed. - Extrusive Igneous Rocks

### Phaneritic 


##### Igneous Rock Textures
- [[Glassy]] texture
	- Special type of [[Aphanitic]] texture
	- Extremely fine-grained, glassy appearance
	- Results from very fast cooling on the Earth's surface 

- [[Vesicular]] texture
	- Special type of [[Aphanitic]] texture
	- Rock contains abundant vesicles or pores
	- Vesicles are remnants of

- [[Porphyritic]] texture
	- A combination of [[Aphanitic]] & [[Phaneritic]] texture
	- Rock contains large mineral crystals in a fine-grained groundmass
	- Resembles choco-chip cookies
	- Indicates a two-stage cooling history
- Stage 1: Initial slow cooling of [[magma]] deep inside the Earth results in coarse-grained crystals called [[Phenocryst]]s
- Stage 2: Eruption of melt containing [[Phenocryst]] crystals on the Earth's surface. Erupted melt cools fast resulting in the fine-grained matrix

# Igneous Rock Classification
- Based on [[silica]] $(SiO_2$ %) 
	- Can be approximated from color shades. 
	- [[Felsic]] = Proportion of lighter-shade minerals higher
	- [[Mafic]] = Proportion of darker-shade minerals higher 
[[Felsic]] (>66%), [[Intermediate]] (52-66%), [[Mafic]] (52-45%), [[Ultramafic]] (<45%)

## [[silica]]te minerals
- The $SiO_4^{4-}$ anionic unit
- The 3D arrangement of Si and O is called [[silica]] tetrahedra (pyramid)
- Arrangement of this silica tetrahedra at the atomic scale determine the internal structure of a particular [[silica]]te mineral

##### Different categories of [[silica]]te minerals
- Isolated [[silica]]te structure. Example: [[olivine]]
- Single chain structure Example: [[Pyroxene]]s ([[augite]] is most common)
- Double chain structure Example: [[Amphibole]]s ([[horneblende]] is most common)
- Sheet [[silica]]te structure Example: [[Mica]]s ([[biotite]] & [[muscovite]] most common)
- Framework [[silica]]te structure Example: [[Feldspar]]s ([[plagioclase]], [[k-feldspar]])

# Bowen's Reaction Series
- Discontinuous Reaction Series - [[silica]]te structure changes progressively with cooling (Left Side: from [[olivine]] to [[k-feldspar]])
- Continuous Reaction Series - [[silica]]te structure remains the same with cooling, only atomic composition changes (Right Side: From Ca-rich to Na-rich [[plagioclase]] [[feldspar]] to [[k-feldspar]])
	- Crystallized minerals react with melt as the melt cools

#### Bowen's Reaction Series
- A melt at ~950 degrees Celcius is crystallizing [[olivine]], [[Pyroxene]] & Ca-rich [[plagioclase]] [[feldspar]].
- If all the melt is used up in crystallization at 950 degrees Celcius, a solid [[Igneous]] rock will contain these minerals.
- If this melt is used up deep inside the Earth, what kind of rock will you get, ([[gabbro]]) 

- A melt at ~750-800 degrees Celcius is crystallizing [[quartz]], [[muscovite]], and [[k-feldspar]]
- If all the melt is used up in crystallization at 750-800 degrees Celcius,

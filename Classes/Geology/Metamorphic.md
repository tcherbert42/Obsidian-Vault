# [[Metamorphic]] Rocks
Pressure, temperature and other factors change rocks into metamorphic rocks.
3 Rocktypes in Geology
- [[Igneous]] - produced from hot rock melts (magma/lava) or ash
	- Examples - Granite, Basalt, Tuff
- [[Sedimentary]] - Compaction & cementation of clasts, shells, chemicals, plant debris
	- Examples - Sandstone, Limestone, Rock salt, Coal
- [[Metamorphic]] - Form when ign./sedi./meta. rocks are subjected to increased P-T(pressure-temp.) conditions
	- Examples - Quartzite, Marble, Slate, Gneiss

### How does P-T conditions change rocks?
Requirement 1: Pre-existing rock (igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic)
	- It takes ~10-12km burial to reach low-grade metamorphic conditions
	- By contrast, lithification to form [[Sedimentary]] rocks occurs at shallow depths
Requirement 2: High pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions
	- Temperature: ~250 - 700 degrees C
	 - Pressure: ~2-12 kilobar

## Metamorphism: General Criteria
Rocks in the Earth can be described by their:
	- Pressure
	- Temperature
	- Lithospheric Stress = Force per unit area acting on the rock

Change one or more of the above criteria such that the rock cannot preserve its original [[Igneous]] or [[Sedimentary]] texture and/or mineral composition. 
- Most important criteria = Pressure(P), Temperature(T)

#### Metamorphism Changes Texture
- Coarser grains in a [[Metamorphic]] rock compared to parent rock
- Fossils are never preserved in a metamorphic rock
	Limestone -> Marble
	Sandstone -> Quartzite 

##### Metamorphism Changes Texture
Metamorphism may create foliation
- [[foliation]] - a texture defined by a [[planar alignment]] of coarse-grained platy minerals (i.e muscovites-bioties), or creation of thick alternating light and dark bands of minerals

### Metamorphism Changes Mineral Composition
- Metamorphism may change mineral composition in some cases
	- Red shale - quartz, clay minerals (e.g kaolinite), and iron oxide
	- Gneiss - quartz, feldspar, biotite, and garnet

# What is [[Metamorphism]]?
A set of pressure - temperature (P-T) - stress conditions
- For a rock at which the rock cannot preserve its original [[Igneous]] or [[Sedimentary]] mineral composition and/or rock texture

## Metamorphic Rock Classification
- Foliated Rocks
	- Preferred alignment of platy materials
	- Has laminations/colored bandings/grains aligned in a particular direction/planar appearance
	- Ex: Slate, Phyllite, Schist, Gneiss
- Non-Foliated
	- Overall Lumpy Appearance
	- Ex: Quartzite, Marble (marble reacts with acid)
	- Parent Rocks: Sandstone -> Quartzite, Limestone -> Marble 

### [[Protoliths]] or Parent Rocks: Foliated Rocks
- Shale is [[Sedimentary]] rock
- When Shale is metamorphosed, you get Slate
- Shale is therefore the parent rock for Slate
- When Slate is metamorphosed, it turns to Phyllite
- P,T, Grain-size increase with depth inside Earth
- Foliated Rocks common in mountains
	- Slate will appear the at the highest depth since it is parent
	- Metamorphism of granite also produces gneiss directly 

# Migmatites: From [[Metamorphic]] to [[Igneous]]
- Gneiss is a high P/T purely [[Metamorphic]] rock
- When gneiss is subjected to even higher P/T, it starts to melt
- When the melt cools, a new rock called migmatite is produced


### Migmatites: From Metamorphic to Igneous
- Migmatites indicate that the gneiss has just started to melt (partial melting)
- Melt = [[Igneous]] feature
	- Very thick alternate bands like gneiss = [[Metamorphic]] feature
- Migmatites preserve characteristics of both [[Igneous]] and [[Metamorphic]] rocks


## Metamorphic Grade (P-T)
- Metamorphic grade indicates the intensity (P-T Conditions) of metamorphism 
	- Low grade - weaker metamorphism
	- High grade - intense metamorphism
- Classification by grade: Low grade (low P-T), intermediate/Medium grade, High grade (high P-T)
Shale -> Slate -> Phyllite -> Schist -> Gneiss

# Rock Exhumation
- The process by which deeper rocks inside the Earth are exposed on the surface is called rock [[exhumation]].
- Erosion over millions of years results in rock [[exhumation]]
- Rocks cool over time as they approach the Earth's surface during [[exhumation]]

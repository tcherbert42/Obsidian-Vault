# Cleavage
Cleavage - a natural tendency to break along planes of weak atomic bonds
- Cleavage produces a set of parallel/repetitive, smooth, flat, shiny surfaces
- Described by the number of set planes and the angles between each set
- Cleavage planes occur throughout the crystal; it often forms parallel steps.

##### Cleavage 
- Examples of cleavage (expressed in directions or sets)
- One set (Horizontal) (Muscovite mica)
- Two sets at ~90 degrees (Pyroxene)
- Two sets NOT at 90 degrees (Amphibole)
- Three directions at 90 degrees (Halite)
- Three sets at 75 degrees (Calcite)

# Hardness
- Hardness (H): A measure of the resistance of a mineral to scratching
	For fingernail,                                H ~ 2.5
	For a penny,                                   H ~ 3.0
	For a glass plate,                          H ~ 5.5
	For a streak plate (porcelain),    H ~ 6.5
	- For Quartz, H > 6.5
	- For Fluorite, H ~ 5.5 - 3.0      

##### Q: If you scratch a mineral on a streak plate and you get a color of the powder of the mineral, what does it tell you about the mineral?
- Hardness is less than ~6.5 (streak plate (porcelain) is ~ 6.5)

# Luster
- Luster: Ability to reflect light. Does it shine like a metal?
- Metallic Luster ex: Pyrite, Galena, Graphite
- Non-metallic Luster ex: Calcite, Olivine, Fluorite, Quartz

# Fracture
- Fracture - describes how a mineral breaks due to external stress (i.e. breakage by impact, shattering, or blow)
- In general, Fracture Patters are: Uneven, Not repetitive like cleavage, Randomly Occuring
- Exception" Quartz displays conchoidal fracture (breaks like glass - along smooth curved surfaces) Produces extremely sharp edges. 

### Special Properties
Calcite: Acid Test/Effervescence
Magnetite: Attracts to a magnet
Graphite: Marks paper

## Special Properties: Specific Gravity
- Specific Gravity = Density of a mineral (felt in terms of weight)
Fluorite - Galena - Pyrite
- For the same size (or volume), a galena or pyrite is heavier than fluorite

# Mineral Crystals
- Crystals - single, continuous pieces of crystalline solid (aka mineral crystals)
- Typically bounded by smooth flat surfaces (aka crystal faces)
- Crystal faces grow naturally when the mineral forms
- Crystals often serve as ideas for architecture
##### Mineral Crystals
- Gemstones - a mineral crystal that may be cut and polished for jewelry
	- Gem mineral crystals reflect light from various faces and angles
	- Minerals crystals with an economic value:     Diamond, Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald

### Looking Inside Crystals
- Science has advanced the study of minerals
- 1912 - Max Van Laue proposed X-ray study of minerals
- X-ray diffraction (XRD) is still used to identify and study mineral structures
- X-ray beam passed through crystal creates distinctive pattern
- Diffraction pattern related to arrangement of atoms in crystals

##### Looking Inside Crystals 
- Ordered atoms in crystals form well-defined geometric patterns
- Atomic patterns repeat regularly in three directions
	- Atomic arrangement is called crystal lattice (Recall mineral definition!)
	- The smallest lattice unit is called unit cell
	- Unit cells repeat in 3 dimensions to produce a crystal lattice structure
- This 3-D internal crystal lattice controls crystal shape

##### Looking Inside Crystals
- Atoms are like tiny spherical balls packed tightly together held in place by chemical bonds
- The shape in which the atoms are packed determines the shape of the crystal lattice
- Physical properties (hardness, crystal form, cleavage) depend on:
	- Arrangement of atoms
	- Nature of atomic bonds 

# Crystallographic Systems (not needed for exams)
- All minerals on this planet can be assigned to any one of these 7 fundamental crystallographic systems based on their fundamental unit cell geometries.
	- There are seven basic three-dimensional lattices: 
	- cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic, rhombohedral, hexagonal, monoclinic, and triclinic

##### Looking Inside Crystals
- The nature of atomic bonds controls physical properties of a mineral
- Polymorph - same chemical composition/formula; different crystalline structure
	-  Example: Diamond and graphite are made entirely of carbon (C)
		- Diamond - atoms are arranged in tetrahedra; hardest mineral
		- Graphite - atoms arranged in sheets; much softer than diamond

# Mineral Crystallization
5 Mineral-Forming Processes 
- Solidification from a melt
- Precipitation from a solution
- Solid-state solution
- Biomineralization
- Precipitation from a gas 
(Mineral Crystallization is the process by which a solid mineral forms naturally on Earth. 
Atoms or molecules are organized into a structure known as a mineral crystal. )

##### Mineral Crystallization
- Solidification from a melt
	- Crystals grow when a rock melt cools
	- Liquid melt freezes to form crystalline solids
	- Rock melts or magma are found deep inside the Earth (e.g. subduction zones, volcanoes)
	- Examples: Feldspars, Olivine, Quartz

##### Mineral Crystallization
Precipitation from a solution
- New crystals form when a solution is saturated with mineral ions
- Precipitation of calcite from water solutions dripping through cave ceilings and onto the floor of the cave.
- Stalactites (grow from cave ceiling; hanging) and stalagmites (grow from floor)
- Example: Calcite (CaCO_3), Halite (NaCl)

##### Mineral Crystallization
Solid Solution
- New crystal structures form when atoms migrate inside a crystalline solid
- Different complex migration/diffusion mechanisms of atoms involved 

##### Mineral Crystallization
Solid Solution 
- Solid solutions in minerals occur through complex atomic diffusion mechanisms at elevated temperatures 
- Atoms substitute for each other in the same crystal structure

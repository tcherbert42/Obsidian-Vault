#### Chapter 1: The Origin of The Universe

How did Lithium Originate?

### The Universe
1. The Galaxy System
	2. The Star System
				3. The Planetary System

## Our Universe
- The universe
- Our Galaxy System: Milky Way
- Our Star System: Sun/Solar System
- Our Planetary System: Earth

##### Age Facts
Today: 0 yrs
Earth: 4.6 bil years
Solar System: 4.6 bil years
Milky Way: 13.5 bil years
The Universe: 13.7 bil years
(1 Ga = 1 giga-annum, or 1 billion yrs)

# Beginning
##### Beginning of Universe = Beginning of Space-Time
- What is the universe made up of?
- How did it all begin? How old is the universe?
- Where did matter and energy come from?

### Structure of the Universe
- The universe is made up of Matter/Mass and Energy

Matter or Mass
- Has mass/weight, volume and density

Energy
- Examples: Kinetic (motion), Heat, Light, Sound, Gravitational
- Convertible to other forms of energy

##### Structure of the Universe..
- Mass-Energy Equivalence: E = mc^2
- Speed of light is 3 x 10^8 
(E = energy, m = mass of object, c = speed of light)

### What is Light?
- Sunlight = White Light = Visible Light
- Ex of Visible Light include: Headlights, kitchen light

- Light is an electro-magnetic wave
- Individual waves may be tightly-spaced or loosely spaced
- Velocity = 3 x 10^8 meters/second

#### Decomposing Visible Light
- Depending on the spacing between individual waves, properties of light vary
- Short wavelength = higher frequency
- Visible Light/Sunlight/Tubelight = only part of the light wave we see
(Wavelength = Distance between two individual crests on the wave. )

##### Decomposing Visible Light...
- Red, green and blue are 3 primary colors in visible light
- Any other color can be expressed as % of red, green, and blue 

##### Decomposing Visible Light...
- Visible Light: Portion of the light visible to human eye
- Visible Light Wavelength: 400-700nm

- Red Light: Longer wavelength, smaller frequency, lower energy
- Violet Light: Shorter wavelength, larger frequency, higher energy
- VIBGYOR colors

### Reference Visible Light: Examples
- Sunlight, tubelight, headlights, manufactured labratory light sources
- Aka. UNSHIFTED LIGHT or REFERENCE VISIBLE LIGHT spectra because these light sources are approximately stationary
- Solid black vertical spectral lines mark specific values of wavelength between 400 - 700 nm

## Doppler Shift
Light coming from a moving source exhibits Doppler effect

- If light source is approaching observer, light shifts towards blue
- If light source is moving away from observer, light shifts towards red

- Red-shifted visible light spectra = Source moving Away
- Regular visible light spectra = Source Stationary or Unshifted
- Blue-shifted visible light spectra = Source Approaching

### Doppler Shift: Stars/Galaxies 
A moving star displays Doppler-shifted light
Light from an approaching star/galaxy is Blue-Shifted
Light from a receding star/galaxy is Red-Shifted

- Light from almost all galaxies are red-shifted
- Of 2 trillion galaxies, light from only ~100 are blue-shifted
- Example of a blue-shifted galaxy: Andromeda Galaxy
(Black vertical lines are spectral lines (or markers).)

##### Question
- If light from almost all galaxies are being red-shifted, what does that tell you about the size of the universe?
- (its expanding)

# The Expanding Universe: Redshift
- Light from galaxies is almost always red-shifted
- Galaxies are moving away from each other at great speed
- Therefore, the universe must be expanding

### The Expanding Universe: Big Bang
- The universe begins 13.7 billion yrs ago with an event called Big Bang
- Big Bang released high amount of energy
- Big Bang created SPACE (mass & energy) and TIME
- The universe has continued to expand and cool since big bang

Unobservable Universe (PAST) : 0 - 380,000 years

##### Question
What is the evidence for Big Bang?

### The Expanding Universe: CMBR
- Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) : Strongest evidence that universe expanded from a very hot, dense state
- CMBR is the afterglow of the Big Bang
- CMBR was emitted after ~380,000 years following Big Bang
- CMBR separates potentially observable universe from unobservable universe

# Summary : Big Bang
-  A cosmologic model that explains the existence of the observable universe through time
- Unobservable universe: 0-380,000 years of Big Bang 
- Potentially Observable universeL 380,000 years after Big Bang CMBR: afterglow of Big Bang and strongest evidence of Big Bang
- CMBR was emitted ~380,000 years after Big Bang

- Big bang is the event from which TIME starts
- Big bang is the beginning of Space and TIme as we know them
(Note: Large Hadron Collider at CERN, Switzerland investigates the very early form of matter created right after Big Bang.)

### Magnetic Polarity Reversals
- Rocks, more specifically the rocks that make up the sea floor, record this magnetic polarity reversal in them exceptionally well
- Anomalously high and low values of magnetic field recorded in seafloor rocks

### Marine Magnetic Anomalies
- Magnetic anomalies in sea-floor rocks
	- Stripes of positive (stronger) and negative (weaker) magnetic intensity 
	- Recorded in sea-floor basalt rocks

##### Evidence of Seafloor Spreading
- Magnetic field flips to normal and reverse as ocean basin widens - (evidence of seafloor moving!)
- Map as stripes of positive and negative magnetic field intensity on either side of mid-ocean ridge
- Width of the anomaly stripes is proportional to the duration of the normal/reverse polarity

#### Magnetic Polarity Reversals
- Magnetic polarity normal and reversal time ranges can be measured using isotope rock dating methods
- Measure rate of seafloor spreading

# Return of the King: Continental Drift
- Continental Drift + Marine magnetic anomalies + Seafloor Spreading -> [[Plate Tectonics]]

### Theory of Plate Tectonics
Based on the idea that Continents & Oceans Move!
- How and where do mountains and seamounts form?
- Where do earthquakes and volcanoes occur?
- How is new crust created and old crust destroyed
- How do old ocean basins close and new ocean basins open?
- Which will be destroyed earlier, Himalaya or Appalachians?

# Plate Tectonics
- [[Plate Tectonics]]: the explanation of "how the solid Earth or geosphere works"
	- Earth's outer shell is broken into rigid plates that move
	- Plates are made up of rocks

##### Plate Tectonics
What are Plates?
- Tectonic Plates = lithosphere
	- Lithosphere is made of both [[crust]] and the rigid/cold upper [[mantle]]
	- The lithosphere is in motion over the hot liquid/fluid [[Asthenosphere]]
(Analogy: Lithosphere = ice, Asthenosphere = water)

##### Plate Tectonics
2 Types of Plates/Lithosphere
- [[Continental Plate]]: ~200 km avg. thickness
	- Felsic to intermediate [[Igneous Rocks]]
		- Lighter (less dense - 2.7 g/cc)
		- More buoyant - floats in [[Subduction Zones & Volcanoes]]
		- High silica, low iron
- [[oceanic plate]]: ~100 km avg. thickness
	- Mafic [[Igneous Rocks]]
		- Heavier (more dense - 3.0 g/cc)
		- Less buoyant - sinks in [[Subduction Zones & Volcanoes]]
		- High iron, low silica
(Continental crust is thicker than oceanic crust. Continental lithosphere is thicker than oceanic lithosphere)

### Plate Boundaries: Tectonic Activity
- Volcanoes
- Earthquakes
- Active Mountain building
- New ocean being created; old ocean being destroyed

# Plate Boundaries
3 Types: [[Divergent]], [[Convergent]], [[Transform]]
- Based on direction of relative plate motion across the plate boundary

### Divergent Plate Boundaries
- Two plates move away from each other across the plate boundary
	- An underwater mountain chain called [[Mid-Ocean Ridge]] forms along the plate boundary
	- Upwelling hot lava pours out at the ridge from [[mantle]] below
	- New solid oceanic [[Lithosphere]] created when hot lava cools into solid rocks
	- Oceanic lithosphere rocktype: [[Basalt]]

##### Divergent Plate Boundaries
- [[Seafloor Spreading]]: Tectonic process by which new [[Oceanic Lithosphere]] is created and moved away from central axis region
- [[Oceanic Lithosphere]] cools as it moves away from ridge-axis and becomes thicker

##### Divergent Plate Boundaries: Seafloor Spreading
- Ocean widens over time
	- New [[crust]] is closer to the ridge
	- Older [[crust]] farther away
	- Oldest oceanic [[crust]] is found at the dar edge of the ocean basin

##### Divergent Plate Boundaries
What happens at divergent plate boundaries
- Non-explosive lava flows
- Small earthquakes
- New oceans are created and become wider
- Continents move apart

### Divergent Plate Boundaries: Mid-Atlantic Ridge
- Linear underwater volcanic mountain range under the [[Atlantic Ocean]]
	- Snakes N-S through the entire [[Atlantic Ocean]]
	- New [[Atlantic Ocean]] floor created symmetrically along axis of the ridge
	- Cut across by transform faults giving it a step-like appearance
(Iceland: Only Land exposure of [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]])

1 Ma = 1 mega-annum, or 1 million years.

# Convergent Plate Boundaries
Plates move towards each other
[[subduction]]: Tectonic process by which the denser plate sinks back into the mantle

### Convergent Plate Boundaries: Subduction Zones
- [[subduction]] consumes oceanic [[Lithosphere]]
- [[Convergent Boundaries]] also called [[Subduction Zones & Volcanoes]]
- Subducting plate is always the denser oceanic [[Lithosphere]]
- [[Overriding Plate]]: The plate that does not subduct
- Continental [[crust]] cannot be completely subducted - too buoyant (lighter)

#### Anatomy of a Subduction Zone
- Trenches
- Accretionary prisms (zone of mixing of material from 2 plates)
- Volcanic arcs or belts
- [[Sedimentary - Rocks & Basins]] basins

##### Anatomy of a Subduction Zone
Volcanoes
- [[Volcanic Arc]] - a chain of volcanoes on overriding plate in the shape of an arc
	- The descending plate partially melts at ~150 km depth
	- Magmas rise and melt through [[Overriding Plate]]

##### Anatomy of a Subduction Zone
Earthquakes
- Subduction triggers earthquakes
- Earthquakes are a characteristic feature of [[Subduction Zones & Volcanoes]]
- Quakes cease below 660 km

### Convergent Plate Boundaries
3 sub-types (Based on the types of [[Lithosphere]] converging)
	1. [[Ocean-Continental Convergent]] Plate Boundary
	2. [[Ocean-Ocean Convergent]] Plate Boundary
	3. [[Continent-Continent Convergent]] Plate Boundary
Plates move towards each other in all 3 sub-types

##### Convergent Plate Boundaries
[[Ocean-Ocean Convergence]]: Japan Trench, Mariana Trench 
- Two oceanic crust plates collide. Older, denser pate usually subducts, site of [[Island Arc]] formation
(characterized by a series of volcanic islands in the shape of an arc)

##### Convergent Plate Boundaries
[[Continent-Continent Convergence]]: Himalaya (active), Appalachian
- Characterized by high mountain ranges (non-volcanic)

# Plate Tectonics

##### Origin of the Theory of Plate Tectonics
- Navigation/Geographers' maps are old
- Plate Boundary Maps - 20th century concept
- Geologists assumed continents remained fixed in their positions through Earth's history


### Alfred Wegener: Continental Drift Hypo. (1915)
- Continents fit together like pieces of a giant jigsaw puzzle to make a vast supercontinent - Pangea
- 1 - 5 is Wegener's evidence for the Continental Drift Hypothesis 

##### 1. Fit of the Continents
- The modern-day continents fit together in the past
- Pangea later fragmented into separate continents that drifted apart, moving slowly 

##### 2. Location of Past Glaciations
- Glaciers are sheets of ice that flow across land
 - Evidence of Late Paleozoic (400 – 250 mill. yrs old) glaciations in 5 continents  
- Wegener: Polar Researcher | Some of these glacial evidences were far from poles  
- Surprisingly, the Paleozoic glaciated area lie next to each other in his reconstructed map of Pangaea  
- Hard to explain the occurrence of these glacial evidences unless continents had moved

- Wegener plotted the orientation of glacial striations from different continents
- On a global map

##### 3. Distribution of Climatic Belts
- If Pangaea existed with its southern part in the vicinity of the South Pole in Late Paleozoic time, then southern Pangaea had Glaciated Climate
- Coal deposits and tropical coral reefs are expected around Equator at that time
- Deserts on either side of the tropics 
- Wegener studied to sedimentary rocks to find these past climate evidences 
(Late Paleozoic sedimentary rocks in PA, WV, KY, IL contain abundant coal. Coal is a terrestrial rock. Why didn't TN contain any?) - it was underwater, thats why it contains marine rocks like limestone

##### 4. Distribution of Fossils
- Many plants & animals live only in one continent - Kangaroo, Joshua Tree
- Land species cannot swim across vast oceans and evolve independently 
- Some Late Paleozoic species existed on several continents

##### 5. Matching Mountain Belts 
- Not only coastlines, rock units adjacent to the coastlines also match. Paleozoic mountain belts in North America, NW Europe and NW Africa have resemblance 
- If the Atlantic didn't exist, Paleozoic mountain belts on all three coasts (Appalachian in North America, NW Europe, and NW Africa) would be adjacent. 

### Despite all these evidences, the Continental Drift Hypothesis was rejected
# Criticism
- Wegener could not explain HOW or WHY continents moved
- Suggested forces generated by Earth's rotation, Tidal Forces 

#### Harry Hess: Seafloor Spreading (1960)
- Before World War II, we knew little about the sea floor 
- Echo-sounding (SONAR) allowed rapid sea-floor mapping
- Sea-floor maps (or bathymetry maps) created by naval ships crossing the oceans
- Bathymetric maps are now produced using satellite data
- Hess mapped the seafloor & proposed the theory of seafloor spreading

##### Hess Identified:
- Mid-oceanic ridges
- Abyssal plains
- Deep-ocean trenches (valleys)
- Submarine volcanoes
- Fracture Zones
(Mid-ocean ridges are very hot, where as the trenches are very cold)

### Theory of Seafloor Spreading (1960) 
Seafloor Moves!

- Upwelling lava/magma from the mantle erupts at mid-oceanic ridges and solidifies to form the basalt rocks of the oceanic crust or seafloor  
- The new seafloor then moved away from the ridge-axis widening the ocean basin – a process now called seafloor spreading  
- At trenches, the seafloor sinks back into the mantle - a process now called subduction
- Earthquake activity at trenches proved this sinking movement 
- Seafloor is attached to continents | Therefore, continents move too! 

(The idea of seafloor spreading in 1960's revolutionized geology because there was now a mechanism available to explain the continental drift hypothesis of Wegener (1915) ) 

# Additional Evidence : Paleomagnetism
- Study of magnetism preserved in rocks that make up the Earth
- Earth's magnetic field resembles the magnetic field produced by a bar magnet
- Earth's magnetic field a.k.a Earth's dipole

### Paleomagnetism
- All solids exhibit magnetism
- An iron-bearing mineral records the magnetic field of Earth at the time of its formation
- When lava is very hot, the thermal energy causes tiny magnetic dipole in the mineral to wobble & tumble chaotically 
- As the lava cools, the dipole align with the Earth's magnetic field & acquire permanent magnetization

##### Earth's Magnetic Poles can flip -> Magnetic Polarity Reversal
- Normal Polarity 
- During normal polarity, the dipole points to the south
- Reversed Polarity
- During reversed polarity, the dipole points to the north 

##### Magnetic Polarity Reversals
- Rocks, more specifically the rocks that make up the sea floor, record this magnetic polarity reversal in them exceptionally well 
- Anomalously high and low values of magnetic field recorded in seafloor rocks 

### Marine Magnetic Anomalies
- Magnetic anomalies in sea-floor rocks
- Stripes of positive (stronger) and negative (weaker) magnetic intensity 
- Recorded in sea-floor basalt rocks
Positive anomalies form when seafloor rock has the same polarity as the present magnetic field. Negative anomalies form when seafloor rock has polarity that is opposite to the present field. 

##### Evidence of Seafloor Spreading
Symmetric Magnetic Polarity Reversals across Mid-ocean ridges
- Magnetic field flips to normal and reverse as ocean basin widens - Evidence of seafloor moving!
- Map as stripes of positive and negative magnetic field intensity on either side of mid ocean ridge

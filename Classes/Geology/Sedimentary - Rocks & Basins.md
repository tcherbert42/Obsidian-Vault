### Rocks 
- Rock - A solid aggregate of geologic materials
- Geologic materials Include: Mostly mineral crystals 
- Igneous, Sedimentary, and Metamorphic

## Principle of Uniformitarianism
>[!quote] The Earth has always changed in uniform ways. The present is the key to the past" - James Hutton
- J Hutton, Scottish geologist/farmer/physician/builder

# [[Sedimentary - Rocks & Basins]] Basin
- Region where loose sediments accumulate over geologic time and turn into [[Sedimentary - Rocks & Basins]] rock. 
- Sediment Ex: loose sand, clay 
- Formed through a process that involves cohesion

### Grand Canyon
- Exposes all 3 types of rocks
- At the base, [[Igneous]] and [[Metamorphic]] rocks are exposed = oldest rock types (>600 Ma)
- Its the layered horizontal [[Sedimentary - Rocks & Basins]] rocks that

# [[Sedimentary - Rocks & Basins]] Rocks
- [[Sedimentary - Rocks & Basins]] rocks are types of rock that are formed by burial, compaction, and cementation of sediment particles at\near the Earth's surface. 
What are [[Sedimentary - Rocks & Basins]] particles?
	- Minerals, rock fragments, fossils, organic matter (carbon)
How are [[Sedimentary - Rocks & Basins]] particles produced?
	- Weathering of high mountains, Chemical reactions, Biochemical activity 
Cold Rocks: 
	< 10-12km, < 300 degrees Celcius 

### [[Clastic]] [[Sedimentary - Rocks & Basins]] Rocks
- [[Clastic]] [[Sedimentary - Rocks & Basins]] rocks are formed via:
	- Weathering - generation of loose sediments via rock disintegration
	- Erosion - transportation of loose sediment by gravity, wind, water, and glaciers
	- Deposition - transported sediments settle out
	- Lithification - deposited sediments turned into solid rock via burial, compaction, and cementation

# Lithification: Sediment -> Sedimentary Rock
- [[Lithification]] - transforms loose sediment into solid rock
	- Burial - Older sediments buried by newer layers of sediment
	- Compaction - Burial adds pressure to sediment
		- Squeezes out water from sediment pores
		- Compresses sediment grains
	- Cementation - Minerals precipitate in sediment pore spaces as water is squeezed out
		- Cementing materials: Submicroscopic quartz or calcite or Fe-oxide cements
		- Cements glue sediments together

##### Main Rocktype in the Cookeville area: Limestones
##### Main river in the Putnam County: Caney Fork
- Caney Fork -> eventually feeds north to Cumberland River

### Mississippi Drainage Basin / Watershed
- The Cumberland River flows through norther TN and IL to join the Ohio River, which joins Mississippi River.
- Limestone rock fragments ([[clasts]]) eroded from Putnam County may end up in Gulf of Mexico
	- Total thickness of sediments deposited in Gulf of Mexico is ~20km. More than the thickness of two Mt. Everest stacked one upon other!
	- Makes Gulf of Mexico an active [[sedimentary basin]]

# Describing [[Clastic]] [[Sedimentary - Rocks & Basins]] Rocks
Classified on the basis of texture and cement composition
- [[Sedimentary - Rocks & Basins]] Texture

### Describing [[Clastic]] [[Sedimentary - Rocks & Basins]] Rocks
- Clast Composition
	- May be individual minerals or rock fragments in the sediments
	- Composition tells us about the original weathered source rock

- Angularity/Roundness - the degree of edge or corner smoothness
	- Freshly produced clasts are usually angular
	- Grain roundness and sphericity increases with transport
		- Well-rounded --- long transport distances
		- Angular --- shorter transport distance
### Describing 
Sorting - the uniformity of grain size
- Well-sorted - all clasts have nearly the same grain size | Poorly sorted - clasts show a wide variety of grain sizes
- Sorting tells us the number of sources involved, 1 source usually 

# Basin / Watershed
- Small rivers around Ouachita Mountains in AR bring sediments from the mountains into the Mississippi river, which also contains sediments from the TN Appalachians. You may get a poorly sorted [[Sedimentary - Rocks & Basins]] rock in the Louisiana Basin with big clasts from Ouachita and small clasts from Appalachians. 

##### Describing [[Clastic]] [[Sedimentary]] Rocks
- Cement - Submicroscopic minerals that f

## Common [[Clastic]] [[Sedimentary]] Rocks: [[Breccia]]
- Course Clastics - pebble/cobble/boulder-sized clasts
	- [[Breccia]] :

## Common [[Clastic]] [[Sedimentary]] Rocks: [[Conglomerate]]
- Course Clastics - pebble/cobble/boulder-sized clasts
	- [[Conglomerate]] : rounded rock fragments
		- Clasts rounded as flowing water transports them and wears off corners and edges
		- Deposited farther from the source than breccia
		- Environment: River Channel

## Common [[Clastic]] [[Sedimentary]] Rocks: [[Sandstone]]
- Medium-grained Clastics - sand sized clasts
	- Sandstone : clastic rock made of sand-sized particles

## Common [[Clastic]] [[Sedimentary]] Rocks: [[Shale]]
- Fine clastics like mud and silt are deposited 

# Bahamas vs middle TN: Geologic Difference
- Bahamas: Active shallow marine carbonate-type depositional environment
- Middle TN: 

### Karst Landscape in middle TN
- [[Karst]] - A landscape resulting from dissolution of carbonate rocks like limestones
- Features: Caves, Sinkholes 

## Depositional environments
- Sediments accumulate in [[sedimentary basin]] where they turn into [[Sedimentary]]
rocks.

### Shallow Marine Silicate-type: Chattanooga Shale
- Sediments experience waves and currents
- Warmer water
- Common rock: [[Shale]], [[Siltstone]]

### Deep Marine: Marcellus Shale, northeast US
- Sediments do not experience waves and tides
- Quite cold deep-water setting
- Common rock: [[Shale]]
- Marcellus Shale and Chattanooga Shale formed at approx. same time (~420-360 Ma)
- Due to the rise and fall of sea levels

# Beach
- Sediments affected by tides, waves and wind
- Ripple Marks: [[Sedimentary]] structures produced by water current flowing over sediments during deposition

## Deserts: Navajo Sandstone, Utah
- Sediments affected by wind
- Cross-Beds: [[Sedimentary]] structures produced by wind current flowing over sediments during deposition 

# Delta
- Sediments deposited by streams entering the sea
- Common rocks: [[Sandstone]], [[Shale]]

### River Beds ([[Fluvial Channels]])
- Sediments deposited by streams in the valley floor
- Common rocks: [[Conglomerates]], [[Sandstone]], [[Shale]]
- Channel-fill [[Sandstone]]s indicate river bed...

## Alluvial Fans
- Sediments deposited by streams as they leave the mountains and enter the plains
- Sediments deposited at the foothills 
- Common rocks: [[Conglomerate]]s, [[Coarse Sandstone]]

# Glaciers
- Sediments deposited by glaciers - moving sheets of ice, in glacial valleys
- Common rocks: [[Conglomerate]]s, [[Breccia]] (conglomerates made of glacial rubble)

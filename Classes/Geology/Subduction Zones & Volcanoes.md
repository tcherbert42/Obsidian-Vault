##### Are all volcanoes explosive?
- Viscosity of the melt determines the degree of explosivity
- Viscosity is the resistance of a fluid to flow - "stickiness" - honey vs water
- Viscosity of [[Igneous]] melts is controlled by SiO (silica) & volatile
- More viscous & volatiles -> more explosive
Between [[Felsic]] and [[Mafic]] melts, which one will be associated with more explosive volcanoes? - Felsic, >66%

### Case 7: Mt. Vesuvius, Italy
- [[Felsic]] melts (rhyolite lava) are associated with violent explosive eruptions - pressure cooker effect
- Presence of volatiles
- Violent volcanic eruptions also eject ash and dust 
(Mt. Vesuvius, violent explosive eruption destroyed the town of Pompeii)

#### Pyroclastic Flows
- [[Pyroclastic Flow]]s: In some cases, during violent eruptions, volcanic ash and debris may run down the slope at great speeds

##### Maurice & Katia Kraft
- Volcano photographers
- Captured some of the most iconic volcanic eruption photographs around the world
- Died in a [[Pyroclastic Flow]] in Japan (Flow speed: 500mph)
- Mt. Vesuvius & Pompeii destruction - [[Pyroclastic Flow]]

### Case 8: Volcanism in Hawaii
- [[Mafic]] melts are non-explosive - more runny!
- [[Basalt]]ic lava

#### What triggers volcanism in Hawaii?
- Hawaii is far from any [[tectonic]] [[Plate Boundaries]] 

## Theory: Mantle Plume Hotspots
- [[mantle]] Plumes are anomalously hot buoyant masses of [[mantle]] material that rises through the [[mantle]]
- Hotspots are surface expressions of [[mantle]] plumes

### Mantle Plume Hotspots
- Plumes/Hotspots are not linked to [[Plate Boundaries]] - they are intra-plate geologic features
- Volume of melt in the plume determines the type of surface expression produced

##### Low Volume Plume-related Volcanism in Hawaii
- Hawaii volcanism is linked to a low-volume [[mantle plume]] hotspot breaching the oceanic Pacific plate
- Pacific plate move from SE to NW over stationary [[mantle plume]]
What are the currently active volcanoes (Rocktype - [[Basalt]]s)

## High Volume Plume-related Volcanism: LIPs
- High volume plume-related volcanism with large plume heads creates [[Large Igneous Provinces]] (LIPs) aka. Flood [[Basalt]] Provinces. 
- Vast size: millions of sq. km
- Variety of fine-grained [[Mafic]]...

### Case 9: Columbia River LIP & YellowStone Super-volcano
- produced by a [[mantle plume]] from under the North American Plate sub-ducting with the Juan de Fuca plate

###### Alfred Wegener
- proposed Continental Drift (1915)
- **Pangea** - Super Continent ([[Pangea]]: means "all worlds")

#### Continental Drift Theory
- Wegener supported his theory with fossils that showed correlations across continents:
- For example: Cynognathus, Lystrosaurus, Glossopteris, and Mesosaurus fossils
- Also, Appalachian mountains in Eastern Coast of US match with coasts in Africa, British Isles, and Caledonian Mountains in Scandinavia 

### Glacial Evidence
- despite this evidence, Wegener's theory was widely rejected due to lack of a plausible **mechanism** (how did they move??)
- Glaciation from South America, Africa, India, Australia, and Antartica all matched
- Fast forward to WWII - now Sonar which would be used to map the ocean floor became available
- Then, in the 1960s, geologists began to study the ocean basins, different types of rocks and sediments discovered on the ocean floor
- Oceanic crust is drastically different than Continental crust - first thing they began to discover
- Then, eventually figured out that they didn't have to go to the ocean to observe oceanic crust (aka obduction (opposite of subduction) led to finding oceanic crust on the surface)

### Oceanic Crust
- Typical composition of oceanic crust: "mafic" rich in magnesium and iron
	- Rock types: basalt, gabbro, peridotite
- Typical composition of continental crust: "felsic" rich in ...
Mid-Atlantic Ridge: basically and underwater mountain range
- examination of the ocean basins revealed the presence of large mountain chains beneath the surface, so called "mid-ocean ridges" (volcanoes and earthquakes)

You can take all the continents and fit them together in the Pacific basin 

###### Harry Hess - US Naval Officer
"Sea floor spreading centers"
- Today we know that Mid-Ocean ridges are **Sea-Floor spreading centers** where magma (molten rock) comes to the surface to form new **oceanic crust**
- This is the **mechanism** that Wegener was missing before he passed away 

If the sea floor is spreading, wouldn't the crust just keep getting larger? Thats where subduction zones come in and keep everything balanced by sub-ducting oceanic crust and transferring it to rising magma on the surface
- Sea floor spreading rate: 20-100 mm/yr
- Center is the youngest and pushing out older crust 

Oceanic crust along the Mid-Ocean Ridge has different polarity. The Earth's magnetic field is flipping, so there is symmetrical evidence of normal polarity or reverse polarity on the ocean crust. (Magnetic Stripes on the ocean floor)
**Sea Floor Spreading centers are production zones for magma** - oceanic floor/crust is being recycled

#### Age of Ocean Floor Rocks

# Plate Tectonics! 
The evidence for sea-floor spreading led to the birth of the subject of **Plate Tectonics** which is the modern version of Alfred Wegener's continental drift concept
[Tectonic = Latin "tekton" = "builder"]

Plate Tectonics: 
- ~ 20 major "plates" make up Earth's crust
- the movement of these plates causes earthquakes
- plate collisions form mountains and plate subduction forms volcanoes

### Plate Tectonics (2)
[[Plate Tectonics]]: the Earth's crust exists as large separate slabs or "plates" that drift slowly over the **[[asthenosphere]]**; Collisions and interactions between these plates is the cause of earthquakes, volcanoes, and mountain building

### **Know the names and locations of the plates for the exam!**

## 3 types of plate boundaries:
1. Covergent - plates collide
	- The Himalayan Mountains were formed by continental collision about 40 million years ago
	- They are still rising today at a rate of ~1cm per year
	- The Appalachian mountains and Rocky mountains were formed in a similar way
	Subduction Zone - a type of convergent boundary where one plate dives beneath another
	- The 'subducted' plate partially melts producing magma that rises to the surface forming a line of volcanic mountains (Andes Mtns, Cascades, Japan, Indonesia)
2. Divergent - plates move away from each other
	- Mid Ocean Ridge - divergent boundary and sea floor spreading center (Iceland lies on the Mid-Ocean-Ridge)
3. Transform - plates move past one another
	- San Andreas fault, California - boundary between the North American and Pacific plates

# Plate Boundaries
- Lithosphere is fragmented into ~12 major tectonic plates
- Plates move continuously at a rate of 1-15 cm/year
- Plates interact along their boundaries 

### Continental Margins
- Where land meets the ocean
	- **Active margins** are near plate boundaries.
	- **Passive margins** are far from plate boundaries.
	- Earthquakes common along active margins

## Three Types
- **Divergent Boundary** - tectonic plates move apart
	- Lithosphere thickens away from the ridge axis
	- New lithosphere created at a divergent boundary
	- Also called: mid-ocean ridge, ridge

- **Convergent Boundary** - tectonic plates move together
	- The process of plate consumption is called subduction
	- Also called: convergent margin, subduction zone, or trench

- **Transform Boundary** - tectonic plates slide sideways
	- Plate material is neither created nor destroyed
	- Also called: transform fault, transform

##### Evidence for Plate Tectonics: Glacial Deposits
- Evidence of Late Paleozoic glaciers found on five continents
- Some of this evidence is now far from the poles
- These glaciers could not be explained unless the continents had moved

### Paleomagnetism
- Rock magnetism can be measured in the laboratory
- The study of fossil magnetism is called paleomagnetism
- Iron (Fe) minerals in rocks preserve information about the magnetic field at the time the rocks formed
	- Declination and inclination preserved in rocks often vary from present latitude/longitude
	- Instruments used in paleomagnetism record changes in position
	- This data is used to trace continental drift

# Magnetic Reversals
- Layered lava flows reveal reversals in magnetic polarity.
	- The magnetic field sometimes "flips"
	- A reversed N magnetic pole is near the S geographic pole
- Reversals are geologically rapid, expressed worldwide
- Can be used as time markers

### Paleomagnetism on the Sea Floor
- Magnetic anomalies map as stripes of positive and negative intensity.
- Magnetic stripes form a pattern
- The pattern is symmetric on either side of the Mid-Ocean-Ridge
- The width of the magnetic anomaly stripes is related to the spreading rate
	- Faster spreading = wide stripes
	- Slower spreading = narrow stripes

###### ~ 40% of the world's population lives along a "plate boundary"

### Earthquakes & Volcanoes
- Hotspots = interplate volcanic activity--not along plate boundaries (Hawaii)
- Earthquakes = How? -- sudden release of stress that has built up along a fault

# Faults
Fault: a fracture of system of fractures in the earth's rigid crust along which movement has occured


### Types of Faults
- Normal Fault - hanging wall drops down relative to footwall
	(hanging wall is ABOVE the fault plane, foot wall BELOW fault plane)
- Reverse Fault - hanging wall block moves up relative to footwall
- Strike-Slip Fault - lateral displacement along fault
- Blind fault - does not appear on the surface and its existence may be unknown 

	Many faults go through a **stick-slip cycle**, but don't assume that all faults behave in a predictable way

	**Tectonic Creep** - gradual movement along a fault that is not accompanied by earthquakes 

# EarthQuake Scale
**Seismograph**: a graph of seismometer data
P - waves: arrive first, primary waves
S - waves: arrive next, secondary waves

# Moment Magnitude Scale
MAGNITUDE is based on:
- the size of the area of the fault plane that moved
- the distance that the fault slipped
- the strength of the rocks along the fault

Magnitude - Duration (sec) - Magnitude of Ground shaking - Estimated Energy Released
	4.0                  1-5                                 1 mm                                      1000 ton bomb
	5.0                  2-15                              10                                          ~32 x greater than 4.0
	6.0                10-30                           100                                          ~ 1,000 x
	7.0                20-30                         1,000                                         ~ 36,000 x
	8.0               30-90                       10,000                                         ~ 1,200,000 x


### EQ Intensity
- The effect of an earthquake on the Earth's surface
- Based on eye-witness reports and surveys of damage
- today, high quality seismic stations can estimate the amount of shaking immediately after an earthquake 
	- "shake maps"
- this is key to getting first responders and aid workers to the hardest hit areas quickly 

# Two Types of Body Waves
- P-wave: Fast, (left and right motion)
- S-wave: slower than p-wave, sheer motion (up and down)

# Seismic Surface Waves

# Topographic Maps
Prime Meridian - 0 Longitude (longitude lines are called Meridians)
Equator - 0 Latitude (latitude lines are called Parallels)

Washington D.C, is at 39 degrees North Lat, ...

MN - magnetic north
GN - grid north
star - true north

##### Magnetic Field of the Earth
- Earth's built-in navigation system (created by the movement of liquid iron in the Earth's Outer Core)
- Magnetic north pole != Geographic north pole (magnetic north poles migrate )

### Topographic Maps Cont ( Elevation)
- Topographic maps contain information about the elevation and the slope of the land. They also show cultural features (roads, buildings, cemeteries).
	- Elevation is the height of the land surface above mean sea level (amsl or asl)
	- elevation is shown with contour lines and contour interval is the elevation change between each contour line

Relief = elevation change between two points

Slope = rate of elevation change ( = relief/distance or rise over run)
1620 ft - 1480 ft = 140 ft

Index contour lines are the more bold lines that usually display a number for the elevation

##### Rule of V's
Where contour lines cross streams, they form a V

Hachured contours show depressions

# The Rock Cycle
Three Rock Laws
1. The law of crosscutting relationships
	- a rock is younger than any rock that is cuts across
2. The law of original horizontality 
	- Sedimentary layers were originally deposited horizontally
3. The law of superposition
	- younger rocks on top and progressively older ones are beneath them (assuming no overturned beds)

### Rock Structures
1. Joints
	- a fracture or gap in otherwise solid bedrock along which no displacement has occurred
2. Faults
	- a fracture along which displacement has occurred; a result of tectonic activity 
	- earthquakes are generated by movement along faults
3.  Folds
	- When rocks are compressed, they may deform into arch-shaped folds
	- the up-warped folds are anticlines and the down-warped folds are synclines 

- All fractures create zones of weakness in rocks. Highly fractured rocks may not be suitable for building dams, bridges, or other structures
- Fractures also create important void space in rocks. This void space may act as a reservoir for groundwater or other fluids

Folds and faults: "traps" for oil and natural gas

### Anticlines and Synclines
Standard is anticlinal ridge and synclinal valley, however there can also be anticlinal valley's and synclinal ridges. 

###### Monoclines
Monocline = another type of fold, with only one limb

#### Domes and Basins
Dome = older rocks towards the middle, younger the farther you go from the middle
Basin = younger rocks towards the middle, older the farther you go from the middle

### Complex Folds and Faults
Thrust fault, thrust slice, and detachment fault

# Three Types of unconformity's
1. Non-conformity
	- a type of unconformity at which sedimentary rocks overlie older igneous or metamorphic rocks
2. Angular unconformity 
	- an unconformity in which the strata below were tilted or folded before the unconformity developed; strata above have a different tilt  
3. Disconformity
	- an unconformity parallel to the 2 sedimentary sequences it separates  

#### Real World Examples of the effect of Geologic Structures
St. Francis Dam collapse, California
- The dam was built about 40 miles north of Los Angeles over an area of metamorphic rocks and sedimentary rocks. 
- Landslides were common in the area. 
- The dam was completed in 1926 to provide water and power for Los Angeles, CA and surrounding towns.

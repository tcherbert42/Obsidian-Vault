# GroundWater and the Hydrologic Cycle
**Conductivity** - the ease with which a rock or sediment transmits a fluid.
High porosity and high permeability = high conductivity.

##### Henri Darcy
- French engineer
- 1856: published a report on the flow of water through sand-filled pipes

Darcy's Law:
    flow through a sand-filled pipe is proportional to:
    - the cross-sectional area of the pipe 
    - the length of the pipe
    - permeability of the sand (Darcy termed this the "hydraulic conductivity")
Q = KIA, where:
    Q = groundwater discharge (m^3/day)
    K = hydraulic conductivity (permeability)(m/day)
    I = hydraulic gradient (ratio) (dh/dl)(m/m)
    A = cross-sectional area of the pipe (m^2)

# Melt Production Zones: Mantle
- [[mantle]] part of

### [[magma]]: Rock-Melt formation inside Earth
- Main source of [[rock-melts]] inside the Earth is [[mantle]]
- Earth's [[mantle]] is almost entirely solid [[Igneous]] rocks (rigid) containing silicate minerals. 
- [[mantle]] temperatures (T) vary between ~1000-3700 degrees C
- In laboratories, most [[Igneous]] rocks begin to melt at T = 800-1200 degrees C

How does Earth's [[mantle]] stay a solid at such high Temperatures?
- High Pressure
When does the rock melt

### [[magma]] Formation: Decompression Melting
- Melting triggered by a reduction in pressure over the hot [[mantle]]
- Melting in a rock can be triggered without adding heat if the rock is already hot enough and pressure is reduced

## Decompression Melting: Occurrence


#### Rifting
- East African Rift Valley, Kenya. This region contains several 

### Case 1: Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania
- Melting is triggered by continental rifting
- Melt comes up and pierces through the thin continental plate

##### Decompression Melting: Occurrence
- Under [[Mid-Ocean Ridge]]s, melting is triggered in the [[mantle]] via pressure reduction when newly produced oceanic [[Lithosphere]] is pushed away ("[[Seafloor Spreading]]") by [[ridge-push]] forces. 

### Case 2: The Mid-Atlantic Ridge
- [[Decompression Melting]] supplies the [[Basalt]] [[Lava]] continually erupting on to the Atlantic Ocean Floor

# [[magma]] Formation: Flux-induced melting
- When volatiles like water, carbon dioxide is added to hot rocks, the melting point of the rocks decreases
- The added water is a flux and this type of melting is called [[flux-induced melting]] 

## Flux-induced Melting: Occurrence
- Chemical reactions in the sub-ducting plate release water (flux) in the hot [[mantle]]
- Water reduces melting point of hot [[mantle]] rocks triggering melting 
- Melt rises upwards

### Case 3: Cascades Volcanic Arc, West Coast
- Mt. St. Helens is an active volcano in the Cascades Range. 
- Subduction of oceanic Juan de Fuca plate under continental North American Plate
- Melt rises up to form a series of volcanic mountains arranged in the shape of an arc - Cascades Volcanic Arc

### Case 4: Andes Volcanic Arc, South America
- Volcanoes in the Andes mountain range are produced due to [[subduction]] of oceanic Nazca plate under continental South American plate. 
- Name "Andesite" comes from Andes mountain range

# Anatomy of a Volcano
- In active volcanoes, [[magma]] chambers accumulate melt rising from [[subduction]]
- In inactive volcanoes, [[magma]] chambers slowly cool into giant [[Intrusive Igneous Rock]] bodies called [[plutons]] or [[batholiths]]. 

### Case 5: Yosemite Granites, Sierra Nevada Range
- [[subduction]] of an ancient [[oceanic plate]] under North America at ~100 Ma
- This [[subduction]] created Sierra Nevada Volcanic mountains just like the Cascades
- Yosemite [[granites]] are [[plutons]] or ancient [[magma chamber]]s
- Volcanoes in the Sierra Nevada region have been eroded away exposing the [[magma chamber]]s that were once located deep inside the Earth. 
- Subduction Zones -> Granite Rock-Melts solidifying into Granite [[plutons]] -> exposed later as natural Granite rock outcrops -> Granite countertops. 

## Anatomy of a Volcano [[dikes]] and [[sills]]
- [[magma chambers]] channels magma outwards towards the surface along conduits that intrude into the surrounding rocks. 
- Vertical Intrusions: [[dikes]], Horizontal Intrusions: [[sills]]

### Case 6: Shiprock, New Mexico
- Three [[dikes]] radiate away from Shiprock, New Mexico, an eroded volcanic neck
- Entire volcano has been eroded away

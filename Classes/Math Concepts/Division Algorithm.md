# For Whole Numbers: Given F >= G
there exist a unique Q and R such that R < G and F = GQ + R
(Q = quotient, R = remainder)

ex:
$$65//7$$
$$ 7(9) = 63, so |65-63 = remainder 2$$
Could also say:
$$65//7$$
$$7(8) = 56, so|65-56 = remainder 9$$
Remainder 9 is greater than divisor (7), so it's wrong. 

$$9483//13$$

$$\frac FG = G\frac QG + \frac RG$$
$$\frac FG = Q + \frac RG$$


# For Polynomials:
Given two polynomials F(x) and G(x) where the degree F(x) >= deg G(x), then there exists unique Q(x) and R(x) such that deg R(x) < deg G(x) and F(x) = G(x)Q(x) + R(x)

ex:

$$(7x^5 + 3x^4 - 2x^2 + 3x-1) // (x^2 + 3x-2)$$

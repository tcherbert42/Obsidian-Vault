How do you find an inverse relation?

	We swap the role of x and y.

If ( -2, 7 ) is in your original relation R, then ( 7, -2 ) is in the inverse relation.

#### Ex:
If the relation is given by the equation of $( y-2 )^3 = 4( x+7 )^2$, then the inverse relation is $( x-2 )^3 = 4( y+7 )^2$.

#### How do you find an inverse function?

1. Check if you have a one-to-one function? If not, split the function into one-to-one portions.
2. Replace f(x) with y. 
3. Swap x and y. 
4. Solve for y.
5. Replace y with $f^{-1}(x)$ which means the inverse function of f. 


#### Ex:
### $f(x) = 2x + 7$

Test for a one-to-one function: Assume f(a) = f(b), while assuming a /= b. If we can solve for a and we get a = b then we can say that f is a one-to-one function. 

Assume f(a) = f(b)

	2a + 7 = 2b +7
			-7      -7

		2a  =  2b
		/2     /2
		  a  =  b
1. so f is a one-to-one function

2. y = 2x + 7
3. x = 2y + 7
	subtract 7 
	$\frac{x-7}{2} = \frac{2y}{2}$
	$\frac{x-7}{2} = y$
#### $f^{-1}(x) =\frac{x-7}{2}$

	
#### Ex:

Test if p(x) = $\frac{2x+4}{x+9}$ and $\frac{9x-4}{2-x}$ are inverse functions. 

# $\frac{2x-3}{4x+8}$

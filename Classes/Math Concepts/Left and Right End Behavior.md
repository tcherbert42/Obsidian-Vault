#### Ex: Sketch what we can tell about $$P(x)= -2x^5-4x^2+2x+9$$
leading coefficient: -2
degree: 5
since the leading coefficient is negative, the right side goes down, but since the degree is positive the left end goes up
#### Ex: Sketch what we can tell about $$P(x) = 5x^6-3x^3+2x-7$$
leading coefficient: 5
degree: 6
since both the leading coefficient and degree are both positive, in the graph, they both go up

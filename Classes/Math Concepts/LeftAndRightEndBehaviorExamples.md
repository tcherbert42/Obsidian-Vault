## EX: Give a dominant term for a polynomial function such that 
$$P(x)\to \infty as x\to \infty and P(x) \to \infty as x \to -\infty$$

## Factored Form: 
$$P(x)=k(x-r)^P(x-r)^P2...(x-r)^Pm$$
#### Easy to find: X-intercepts(zeroes), above or below the x-axis
Graphing by inequality
Ex: 
$$P(x)=-2(x-3)^4(x+7)^2(x+1)^3$$
- Find the zeroes or X-intercepts( y=0, or P(x)=0 )
	Solve:
	$$0=-2(x-3)^4(x+7)^2(x+1)^3$$
What are the distinct factors? - 2, x - 3, x + 7, x + 1
Set said distinct factors = 0
$$-2=0 | x-3=0 | x+7=0 | x+1=0$$
-2=0 does not contribute a solution, but the other 3 do
$$x = 3 | x - (-7) | x - (-1)$$
So far, this is what we know about the graph of P(x)

Intervals:
$$(-\infty, -7)|(-7,-1)|(-1,3)|(3,\infty)$$

$$(-8),(-3),(0),(724,972)$$


#### Easy to find: Y-Intercepts
Plug 0 in for X

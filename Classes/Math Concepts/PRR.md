Ex:
$$P(x) = 2x^3 +3x^2 -1$$
1) find the possible rational roots
2) Constant: -1
4) PRR:
![[Drawing.PRR]]

Is "+1" a root of: $$P(x) = 2x^3 + 3x^2 -1$$
$$P(1) = 2(1)^3 + 3(1)^2 -1 = 2 + 3 - 1 = 4 =/ 0$$
"+1" is not a root nor is "x-1" ever a factor of P(x).

Is "-1" a root of: $$P(x) = 2x^3 + 3x^2 -1$$
$$P(-1) = 2(-1)^3 + 3(-1)^2 -1 = -2 + 3-1 = 0$$
0 = 0 , so "-1" is a root of and "x+1" is a factor of P(x).


Now we need to do division for our first branching.

Real Zeroes: 1/2, - 1
Multiplicity: 1, 2




EX:

$$P(x) = 2x^4 -5x^3 -2x^2 +11x -6$$
Constant: -6
Factors: +-1, +-2, +-3, +-6
L.Coeff: 2, Factors: +-1, +-2
PRR: +-1, +-2, +-3, +-6, +-1/2, +-2/3, +-3/2, +-6/2

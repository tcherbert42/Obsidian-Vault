1) Compare to 0.
2) Factor as much as possible.
(sign chart)

ex: Solve 
## $x*x*(x+1)*(x+1) = 0$

x = 0, x=0, x=-1, x=1

ex:(2)solve

## $\frac{x-4}{x+2}>= 1$

subtract the 1
greater than or equal to 0
### $\frac{x-4}{x+1} -1>= 0$

-1 becomes 1 over 1
then multiply 1 over 1 by x+2 to get common denom.

#### $\frac{x-4}{x+2} - \frac{x+2}{x+2} >= 0$

Like Terms:

##### $\frac{-6}{x+2} >= 0$

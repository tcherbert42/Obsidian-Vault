## Two Forms
#### General Form: $$P(x) = a^nx^n + ... + a^0$$ 
#### ex: $$P(x) = 3x^5 + 7x^4 - 3x^3 + 4x^2 - 5x+6$$

		y-intercept: Find P(0) = plug 0 in for x
		return (0, a(0))
			a(0) in this situation, is called the constant (every other term has the variable X involved, it never changes)

## End Behavior: P(x) = a(n)x(n)  + ... + a^0
$$a^nx^n$$ is the dominant term. (A being the leading coefficient and the exponent of X being the degree.)

		The leading coefficient guides the right end. 
		- If $$(a^n) > 0$$, then P(x) go to infinity as X gets larger
			in the postuve direction
		- If a^n < 0 , then P(x) go to -infinity as X gets 
			larger in the positive direction

	For left end we need to know the right end behavior and the degree.

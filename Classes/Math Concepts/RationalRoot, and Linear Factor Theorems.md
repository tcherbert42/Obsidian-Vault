# Rational Root (Zero) Theorem:

#### Purpose: to give us possible rational numbers that could give a result of zero from the polynomial. 
	How: we find the ratios of the factors of the constant over the factors of the leading coefficient.

ex: 
$$P(x) = x^3 -2x -5x + 6$$
term without exponent is the constant (6)
factors of the constant: +- 1, +- 2, +- 3, +- 6 (positive or negative)
leading coefficient: 1
factors of coefficient: +-1

PRR:(positive rational roots) $$\frac 11, \frac 21, \frac 31, \frac 61 = 1,2,3,6$$
Possible x-intercepts : ( 1, 0), (-1, 0), (2, 0), (-2, 0), (3, 0), (-3, 0), (6, 0), (-6, 0)

actual intercpets: (-2, 0), (1, 0), (3, 0) 
see excalidraw last section 


# Linear Factor Theorem: 
#### Purpose: Make a connection betweeen roots (zeroes) and factors of a polynomial (which has x involved)
	How: If you know that "K" is a root of the polynomial, then x - k is a facor of the polynomial; and vice versa 

"K" is a root of a polynomial if P(k) = 0

Possible x-interepts: (1, 0), (-1, 0), (2, 0), (-2, 0)
										(3, 0), (-3, 0), (6, 0), (-6,0)

Possible Factors: x-1, x+1, x-2, x+2, x-3, x+3, x-6, X+6

##### Formatting
To use stream maniplulators, you must include iomanip
you also must already have iostream

- setw(n) - sets the field wifth (n) for the next output item only
- left - changes to left alignment
- right - changes back to right alignment

##### Using setw(n)
Replace "n" with a number
cout << setw(10) << "Crockett" << "Pen" ;
cout << setw(5) << "1300" << endL << setw(10) << "Class" ; 

#### Examples
numberColumns.cpp
numberColumns_setw.cpp
leftright.cpp

##### The cin Process
- cin waits until the user presses [Enter] key
- cin reads value from keybaord and places it in a buffer
- cin converts data to the type that matches the variable

#### Ex: 
int height; 
cout << "How tall is the room? ";
cin >> height;

##### Input More than One Value
- Can be used to input more than one value:
	cin >> height >> width;
	
- Multiple values from keyboard must be seperated by spaces.
- Order is important:
first value entered goes to first variable, etc.

## Multi-Line Comments
- Begin with /* end with  */
- Use a multi line xomment at the top of all programs

### WhiteSpace
- Whitespace refers to blank spaces between items within a statement
- Good practice is to deliberately and consistently use whitespace to make a program more readable.
- Most items are separted by one space (and not less or more ). No space precedes an ending semicolon

### Indentions
- Indentions are not required for a C++ program to compile, but aid in readability of code.
- Indentions can be 3 to 4 spaces

## Syntax Errors
- Syntax Error = an error that violates a programming language's rule on how symbols can be combined to create a program. 

## Logic Errors
- Logic Error = an error that occurs WHILE A PROGRAM RUNS ( runtime error )
- An example of a logic error is trying to divide a number by zero, or an infinite loop
- A logic error is known as a type of runtime error or bug. 
- Example program: badProgram2.cpp

## Warnings
- Indicates a possible logic error but doesn't stop the compiler from creating an executable program. 
- Some complilers will report a warning like "Warning, divided by 0 is not defined"
- You can force all warnings to appear when compliling your code using -wall

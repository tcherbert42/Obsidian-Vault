### Arithmetic Expressions
- An expression is any individiual item or combination of items, like variables, literals, operators, and parenthesis, that evaluates to a value. 
- Variables = storage locations in computers memory
- Literals = 

### Integer Division
- When the fivision operands are integers, the division operator '/' performs integer division, throwing away any remainder. 

Arithmetic Expression                     C++ Result
- 24/10                                                        2
- 50/50                                                        1
- 1/2                                                              0

### C++ Standard Library (cstdlib)
- The C++ Standard library header file can be used by placing include cstdlib at the top of the file
- Math Functions = absolute value (abs), integer division (div)
- Conversion Functions  = like converting string to a double, string to integer, etc. (atof, atoll, atoi, strtol, strtod, strtoll)
- Generate Random Numbers (rand, srand)
- Searching and Sorting (bsearch, qsort)
- Constants (EXIT_SUCESS, EXIT_FAILURE) - These can be used as a return value 


## Creating Random Numbers
- Some programs need to use a random number. 
- The rand() function returns a random integer each time the function is called, in the range 0 to RAND_MAX is a machine dependent value, but is at least 32,767
- You must include the C standard library to use rand

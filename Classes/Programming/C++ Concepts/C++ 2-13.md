# While Loops

```c++
int number = 1;
while (number <= 5) {
	cout << "Hello";
}
```

### Input Validation Loop
##### The WHILE LOOP should be used for validating user input
- Below is an exmaple of validationg that the user entered a number between 1 ad 5 inclusively:

```c++
cout << "Enter a number 1 to 5: ";
cin >> number;
while (number < 1 || number > 5)
{
	cout << "..."
}
```

### Using the C++ Limits Library
- You can use climits libary to use integer constants like in the C++ Library such as the max or min value for a particular data type
```c++
#include <climits>
```

#### Keeping a running total
- Getting a running total (sum of values) is a common requirement in programming
- A running total is an accumulated sum of numbers from each repition of the loop
- An ACCUMULATOR is a variable that holds the running total

```c++
int sum = 0;
int num = 1;
while (num <= 10) {
	sum += num;
	num++;        //Increment ( num = num + 1 )
}
cout << "Sum of numbers 1 - 10 is" << sum << endl;
```

# Do-While loop syntax

```c++
int number = 1;
do{
	cout << "Hello";
	number += 1;
} while (number <= 5);
```

#### Do-While Loop
- Although the expression is false, this loop will execute one time because the do-while is a post-test loop.

```c++
int x = 1;
do{
	cout << x << endl;
	x = x + 1;
} while ...
```

### When use Do-while loop?
- Always use a do-while to control running an entire program multiple times based on user decision

```c++
char response;
do {
	//entire program
	cout << "Do you wish to run again?\n";
	cin >> response;
}while(response == y ...)
```
- Also good to use in a menu-based program when a menu option is to quit the program ( also use a switch to decide what the user wants to do )

# Increment Operator
- Increment operator ++
- Some programming languages, like python, does not have an increment operator.

val++; is the same as val = val + 1; or val += 1;

- ++ can be used before (prefix) or after (postfix) a varible:
	val++          ++val

# Decrement Operator
-  Decrement operator --

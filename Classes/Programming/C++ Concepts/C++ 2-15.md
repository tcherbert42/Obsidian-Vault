# Increment / Decrement
- Can be put before or after the variable but produce different outputs
- Pre-fix and Post-fix operations will cause different comparisons ( ++num or num++ )

```c++
// Can be used in expressions
result = num1++ + --num2;

// Can also be used in relational expressions
if (++num > limit)
	result...
	// the increment happens AFTER the if statement checks if num is greater than limit 
```


### For Loop Syntax
( when incrementing by 1 at each iteration )

```C++
for(int i=1; i<=5; i++)
	cout << "Hello";
```

- it's okay to not declare i at the top of the program as long as the scope of i is ONLY the for loop.

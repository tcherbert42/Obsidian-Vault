# Using Files for Data Storage
- You can use files instead of keyboard, monitor screen for program input and/or output.
- Allows data to be retained between program runs

##### Steps
- Create file variable
- open the file
- use the file (read from, write to, or both)
- Close the file

### Step 1. Create File Variable
- Use ofstream to crete a new output file stream
- Use fstream header file in order to read from or write to text files in your programs.
- ofstream is a data type. Technically it is a "file stream object".


```C++
ofstream outfile;
```

### Step 2. Open the text file
- Use the open function to open the physical file on your computer. 

```C++
outfile.open("anotherFile.txt")
```

### Step 3.
- Use << to write something to the output file. Here are some examples. 

```C++
outfile << "Hello, World!\n";
outfile << 7;
string data = "hot dog";
outfile << "We will have a " << data << endl;
double num = 85.43
outfile << num << endl;
```

### Step 4.
- Use the close function to close the file. 

```C++
outfile.close()
```


## Example:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main {

	ofstream outputFile;

	// Open the file
	outputFile.open("demoFile.txt"); // Default mode for outFile is truncate mode (deletes everything on open)

	cout << "Now writing data to the file." << endl;

	outputFile << "Bach\n";
	outputFile << "Beethoven\n";
	outputFile << "Mozhart\n";
	outputFile << "Schubert\n";

	// Close the file
	outputFile.close();

	// Open file
	outputFile.open("demoFile.txt", ios::app); // ios::app is a flag, and it changes from truncate to append. 
	outputFile << 3948 << endl;
	outputFile << 7 << endl;
	outputFile << 328472 << endl;
	outputFile.close(); // Close the file

	cout << "Done!\n";

	return 0;
}
```

### Opening in Append Mode
- The default mode for opening a file is ios::trunc (truncate) mode, which means every time you open the file for writing, everything is erased and it starts writing at the top of the file.

### Let the user Name the text file
- You can allow the user to enter the name of the text file to be opened. This can work with input files or output files. 


# File Input
- Use fstream header file in order to reat and write 
- use ifstream to creat a new INPUT file stream
- if the file does NOT exist, it will not create one!

```C++
#include <fstream>

ifstream inFile;

if(inFile.is_open())
// If this is true the file exists and has been opened. 
```

### Read from Text File
- Use >> to read something from an input file.

```C++
string data;
inFile >> data;
```

or 

- You can use the getline function to read a line from the input file 
```C++
string lineOfData;
getline(inFile, lineOfData);
```

### Close the file
- Use the close function after you are done

```C++
inFile.close()
```

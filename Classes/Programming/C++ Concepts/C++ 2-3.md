# Module 4 : Branching

##### If Branch
- if the relational expression is true, the statement will execute
- if not, the statement will NOT execute
if ( relation expression )
	statement;
	- be careful testing floats and doubles for equality
	- 0 is false and any other value is true.

-- ADD curly braces to execute more than one statement if the expression is true --
```c++
// Relational Expression 
if (score > 90)
{
	//Multiple statements to execute in squiggly brackets
	grade = 'A';
	cout << "Great Job!\n";
	cout << "You made an A!\n";
}
```

##### Relational Operators
Same in Python
greater than >
less than <
equal to ==
does not equal !=
greater than or equal >= 
...

##### Else If

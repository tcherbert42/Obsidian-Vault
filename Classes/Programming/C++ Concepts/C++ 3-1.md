# Overloaded Functions
- Two or more functions that have the exact same name, but have different parameter lists. 
- Parameter list can be different in the data types or # of parameters
- Can be used to create functions that perform the same task but take different parameters
-  Compiler will determine which version of function to call by arument and parameter list

```C++

void getDimensions(int);             // 1 
void getDimensions(int, int);        // 2
void getDimensions(int, double);     // 3
void getDimensions(double, double);  // 4

```

# Global Constants and Static Local Variables
- Main memory is divided into four segments: data, heap, stack, and code
- Global variables and static local variables are created in the data segment in memory
- Variables are called glocal variables if they are defined outside of all functions (at the top of the source file). DO NOT USE global variables because they make programs diffcult to debug. 
- The only exception is global constants

```C++
const double TAX_RATE = .0975;
```

### Static Local Variables
- Local Variables only exist while the function is executing. When the function terminates, the contents of local variables are lost.

# Header Files
- In C++ there are two types of header files
	- Pre-existing header files: files which are already avaliable in C++ compiler we just need to import them. 
		```C++
		#include <filename>
		#include <iostream>
```
	- User-defined header files 
	```C++
		#include "filename.h"
		#include "shapes.h"
```

# Passing an Array to a function

- When you pass an array to a function, it is being passed by reference instead of by value because the array name is the memory address of the array. 
- There is no need to use the address operator. 

- In the function prototype, you put the data type of the array and then empty square brackets
- you also usually pass the size of the array as a separate integer parameter. 
```C++ 
void findMaxInArray(int[], int); // function prototype
```

- In the function call statement, you only put the name of the array when passing the array. Do not put the data type or the square brackets. 
```C++
findMaxInArray(myArray, SIZE);
```

- In the function header, you put the data type, name of the array, and empty square brackets for the array parameter. 
```C++
void findMaxInArray(int myArray[], int size);
```

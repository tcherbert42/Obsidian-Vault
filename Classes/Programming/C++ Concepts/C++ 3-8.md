##### Module 8 Arrays
# Arrays in C++
- An array is a variable that can hold mutiple values of the same data type. For example, you could create a variable to hold five integers, instead of just one. 
- Arrays are BUILT-IN to the C++ language.
- There are no functions like "append" or "pop" to aid in array operations

### Defining an Array in C++

```c++
int tests[5]; // <- size declarator 
```

- The definition above allocates a five-element integer array named tests and looks like this in memory: 
- Last index of the array is the size of the array minus 1. 
- Meaning if you had an array with a size of 5: its stars at zero and ends at 4. 

##### Named Constants as Size Declarators
- Named constants are commonly used as size declarators. 

```c++
const int SIZE = 5;
int tests[SIZE];
```

### Accessing Array Elements
- Array elements can be used as regular variables: 
```C++
tests[0] = 79;
cout << tests[0];
cin >> tests[1]; // input 89
tests[4] = tests[0] + tests[1]; // 169 gets added to tests[4] (79 + 89)
```

- Arrays must be accessed via individual elements:
```C++
cout << tests; //prints memory address, not values 
```

### No bounds checking in C++
- When you use a value as an array index, C++ DOES NOT check it to make sure it is a VALID index. 
- In other words, you can use an idex that is beyond the bounds of the array. This can corrupt other memory locations, crash program, or lock up computer, cause elusive bugs and possibly the end of the world. 

##### Find maximum number algorithm
```C++
maxValue = myArray[0];
for(int i = 0; i < numElements; i++)
{
     if(myArray[i] > maxValue)
        maxValue = myArray[i];
}
cout << maxValue << " is the largest value in the array.\n";
```

##### Find sum of all elements algorithm
```C++
total = 0;
for(int i=0; i < numElements; i++)
{
	total += myArray[i];
}
cout << total << " is the ..."
```

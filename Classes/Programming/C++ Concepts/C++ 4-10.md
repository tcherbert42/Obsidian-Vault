##### Abstract Data Types
- A data type defines the values that can be stored in a variable and the operations that can be performed on it
- Primitive Data Types:  char, short, bool, int, float, etc.

### Abstraction
- A general model of something. (captures general characteristics without details)

# Abstract Data Types
- created by the programmer
- composed of 1 or more primitive data types or other abstract data types (ADTs)
- Programmer decides what values are acceptable for the data type
- Programmer decides what operations can be perfomed with the data type

### Grouping Data into Structures
- Structure: C++ construct that allows multiple variables to be grouped together. A structure is a way to implement an Abstract Data Type. 

```C++
struct <structName>
{
	type1 field1;
	type2 field2;
};

// For Example
struct Student
{
	int studentID;
	string name;
	short yearInSchool;
	double gpa;
};
```

- Must have ; after closing }
- struct names commonly begin with uppercase letter
- Multiple fields of same type can be in comma-separated list
```C++
string name, address;
```

##### Defining a Structure Variable
- Struct declaration does not allocate memory or create variables
- To define variables, use structure tag as type name:

### Accessing Structure Members (Dot Operator)
- Use the dot ( . ) operator to refer to members of struct variables.
```C++
Student stu1;
cin >> stu1.studentID;
getline(cin, stu1.name);
stu1.gpa = 3.75;

//Member variables can be used in any manner appropriate for their data type
```

## Displaying a struct variable
- To display the contents of a struct varirable, must display each field separately, using the dot operator. 

```C++
cout << stu1; // won't work
cout << stu1.studentID << endl; //correct
cout << stu1.name << endl; //correct
cout << stu1.yearInSchool; //correct
cout << " " << stu1.gpa; //correct
```

### Comparing struct Variables
- If stu2 is another Student variable, how do you compare?

```C++
//Cannot compare struct variables directly:
if (stu1 == stu2) // won't work

//Instead, must compare on a field basis:
if (stu1.studentID == stu2.studentID) //correct
```

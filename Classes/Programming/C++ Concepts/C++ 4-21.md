# Constructors
- Member function that is automatically called when an object is created
- Purpose is to construct an object
- [Constructor] function name is class name
- Has no return type

### Default Constructors
- A [default constructor] is a [constructor] that takes no [arguments] (empty parameter list).
- If you write a class with no constructor at all, C++ will write a default constructor for you, one that does nothing.
- Creating an instance (object) of a class with no arguments calls the default constructor:
- Rectangle r;

## Overloaded Constructors
- Passing Arguments to Constructors. 
	- To create a constructor that takes arguments: indicate parameters in prototype:
		```C++
		Rectangle(double double);
```
	- Use parameters in the definition:
	```C++
		Rectangle::Rectangle(double w, double len)
		{
			width = w;
			length = len;
		}
```

- You can then pass arguments to the constructor when you create an object:
```C++
	Rectangle r(10, 5);
```

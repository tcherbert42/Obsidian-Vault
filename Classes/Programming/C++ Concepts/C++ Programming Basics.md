Procedural Design = is used to model programs that have an obvious flow of data from input to output.
 - procedural programming is a programming paradigm built around the idea that programs are sequences of instructions to be executed. 

The typical instruction types of a program is input, processing, and output. 

- Code = a textual representation of a program
- Line = a row of text
- Main = where the program starts ( a function )
- Braces = enclose a block of statements 
- Statement = a program instruction ( all end in a semicolon ";")
- Return Statement = where the program ends. The zero in return 0; tells the operating system that the program is ending without an error. 

### Variables 

-  All programming languages use variables to store information to be refrenced and manipulated in a computer program. 
-  Variables must be defined in C++ with a statement called a Variable Defenition before they can be used. 
-  A variable defenition contains the data type of the information that will be stored in that variable along with the name of the variable. 
EX: int height = blah

#### Basic Output 
cout - stands for Console OUTput OR Characters OUT
- classified as a stream object - works with streams of data
- Used to display info to the screen
- Must use 
- Must use "less than less than"

##### Escape sequences
/n - newline - causes output to go down to next line
/b - backspace - backup one space

##### endl 
endl (pronounced endline) causes output to go down to next line

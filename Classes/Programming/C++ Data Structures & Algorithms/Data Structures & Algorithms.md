### Data Structures
-  Like a deck of cards
- Each card is a piece of data, and we can arrange cards in different ways depending on what we're using them for.
- Data structures are different ways of organizing data programmatically. 

- Different data structures are useful for different applications. They all have advantagees and limitations. 
- A good programmer knows how to be critical of those limitations to discern when is best to use a particular structure. 

### Algorithms 
- Algorithms are processes that have a consistent set of instructions to follow. Cooking recipes are a kind of algorithm! Once we have data, algorithms are things that we do with that data. 
- They can be as simple as finding the smallest in a group of numbers to as complex as giving directions on a map. 

- There are different algorithms to solve the same problem, which each have their own advantages and limitations. (typically differences in space and time efficiency)
- A good programmer knows how to be criticl of those limitations to discern when is best to use a particular algorithm. 

#### Data Types
- Data types describe the.. type of data you're using. This should be familiar from 1300. You've used different kinds of numbers, characters, strings, etc. 
- There are primitive data types, build into the language ( int, float, bool)

# Abstraction
- Abstract data types are used to represent something that's more complicated than just numbers. 
- We use abstraction to represent something computationally that doesn't otherwise make sense to a computer.

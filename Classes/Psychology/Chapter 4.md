# Biopsychology
- Biopsychology explores the biological mechanisms that underlie behavior.

Among many things it studies:
- Genetics - focusing on how inherited genes can affect not just the physiological

### Human Genetics
- Studying human genetics can help researchers understand the bioloical basis underlying the different behaviors, thoughts and reactions of humans
	- Why do two people infected by the same disease have different outcomes?
	- Are there genetic components to psychological disorders, such as depression
	- How are gentic diseases passed through family lines

### Theory of Evolution
- Charles Darwin explored the concept of inheritance of traits throughout generations in his theory of evolution through natural selection
	- The orgranisms that are better suited for their environment will survive and reproduce, while those that are poorly suited for their environment will die off.

Characteristics and behaviors that impact survival and reproduction:
- Those that help protect against predators
- Those that increase access to food
- Those that help to offspring alive 

##### So why have certain genetic diseases that cause people to die not become less common?
- Example: Sickle cell anemia
	- A genetic condition in which red blood cells take on a cresent-like shape affecting how they function
	- Causes many people to die at an early age but it is still common among people of African decent
	- Carriers of only one copy of the sickle cell gene are thought to be immune from malaria, a deadly disease which is common in Africa
	- In this example, carrying the gene makes a person better suited for their environment

### Genetic Variation 
- The genetic difference between individuals
- Contributes to a species' adaptation to its environment
- Begins when an egg ( containing 23 chromosomes ) is fertilized by a sperm ( containing 23 chromosomes ).

Chromosome = long strand of genetic information known as DNA
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) = helix-shaped molecule made of nucleotide base pairs.
In each chromosome, sequence of DNA make up genes
Gene = sequence of DNA that controls or partially controls physical characteristics known as traits ( eye color, hair color, etc.)
A gene may have multiple possible variations or alleles ( a specific version of a gene ).
- A specific gene may code for hair color and the different alleles of that gene affect what the hair color will be

## Neurotransmitters
- Neurotransmitter = chemical messenger of the nervous system
Different nuerons release different types of neurotransmitters that have many different functions

- Biological perspective = view that psychological disorders like depression and schizophrenia are associated with im balances in one or more neurotransmitter systems
- Acetylcholine = muscle action and memory
- Beta-endorphin = pain and pleasure
- Dopamine = mood, sleep, and learning
- Norepinephrine = Heart, intestines, and alertness
- Serotonin = 

### The Two Hemispheres
- Lateralization - concept that each hemisphere of the brain is associated with specialized functions
	- The left hemisphere controls the right side of the body
	- The right hemisphere controls the left side of the body

The surface of the brain is covered with gyri and sulci. A deep sulcus is called a fissure, such as the longitudinal fissure that divides the brain into left and right hemispheres.

#### Forebrain, Midbrain, and Hindbrain
- The brain and its parts can be divided into 3 categories

##### The Forebrain
- The forebrain is the largest part of the brain
It Contains:
- The cerebral cortex
- The

# Report Writing - Crash Course (CPTC)

## What is a report
Teach your client - Tell the story
- Should include good and bad

Executive Summary - A high level overview of what you did, and found
Technical Findings - All the details you could want, how severe, impact, how to reproduce it
- (Technical Findings or Executive briefing - today! - fix this, over the next week  - fix this, next month - fix this)
Strategic Plan - Where you give your advice on remediation (recommendations to implement, fix)
Inject Responses - Address extra stuff that happened during the comp
Engagement Outline - Methodology, Scope, Network Diagram
Appendices - Extra information galore (make it useful)

## What makes a good report
Not perfect - will not be able to make a perfect report
Sourced facts - screenshots are the best evidence
Sourced expert analysis (NIST, etc) - Back up your statements
Opportunities for learning - Technical: Find, Fix, Retest (how to reproduce it!), Business: How it affects them (how much can they lose!), Everyone: Why its worth thinking about, (provide reasons as to why they should care)) 
Part of a Story - Your report is one of many inputs to a security picture (Need to know how it works, understanding, they will ask questions!)
Facts - Hard to misunderstand, Have been verified

##### Things to Remember:
- Analysis and Opinion come second
- Allow for unknowns (sometimes company relies on the super outdated system to not lose money, they are not stupid)
- Your report is your contribution, and it will live forever
- You do not know the whole story 
Don't say their stuff is secure, it almost never is, and you do not know

## What Makes a bad report
Be Careful:
- Avoid using the word "should" or "it is recommended" recommended by who?
- We want to consider tone
- Don't ever imply fixes are "easy"
	- Add message like "barring other issues" to remediation
What Doesn't work:
- Screenshots in mass and reporting later
- Words in notes app, write report later
- Fill in the blank reports
- "May contain" statements

## Formatting Tips and Tricks
1. Text should be a similar size to document
	- Multiple screenshots of good size are better than one screenshot with small text 
2. Only show what is necessary
3. Don't show faces (Don't show employee who let you in the door!!)
4. For websites, if able, shrink windows to let page auto-sizing do work for you
5. Compose your screenshots (move windows around, make things look nice)

## Special Tips
Boiler-plating:
1. Collect library advice for copy and paste
	- Write your boilerplate outside of other written reports
2. Keep collection of commonly used sentences and paragraphs
	- Never copy and paste from other reports at risk of leaking customer data

Tricking Word:
1. Don't use word for Web
2. Make word work for you:
	- Autocorrect
	- Quick Parts and Auto Text
	- Custom Dictionary
	- Styles and Sections
	- Macros
	- Quick Access Toolbar and Keyboard shortcuts 
	- Form Fields and Variables

# MakeFiles
While modular compilation offers many advantages, manually compiling and linking a program with numerous source and header files can be challenging. For example, a change within a single header file will require recompiling all source files that include that header file. Keeping track of these dependencies to determine which files need to be recompiled is not trivial and can require considerable effort, if done manually. For large programs, programmers often utilize **project management tools** to automate the compilation and linking process. **make** is one project management tool that is commonly used on Unix and Linux computer systems.

The make utility uses a **makefile** to recompile and link a program whenever changes are made to the source or header files. The makefile consists of a set of rules and commands. **Make rules** are used to specify dependencies between a target file (e.g., object files and executable) and a set of prerequisite files that are needed to generate the target file (e.g., source and header files). A make rule can include one or more commands -- referred to as **make recipe** -- that will be executed in order to generate the target file. The following shows the general form for a make rule. The make rule's target and prerequisites are defined on a single line. The commands for the make rule should be specified one per line starting with a single tab character.

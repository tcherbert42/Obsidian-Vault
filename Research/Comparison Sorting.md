### [[Comparison Sorting]] in C++
- A element [[Comparison Sorting]] [[algorithm]] is a [[Sorting]] [[algorithm]] that operates on an [[Array]] of elements that can be compared to each other. 
- Ex: An [[Array]] of strings can be sorted with a [[Comparison Sorting]] [[algorithm]], since two strings can be compared to determine if the one string is less than, equal to, or greater than another string. 
- [[Selection Sort]], [[Insertion Sort]], [[Shell Sort]], [[Quick Sort]], [[Merge Sort]], and [[Heap Sort]] are all [[Comparison Sorting]] [[algorithm]]s. 
- [[Radix Sort]] in contrast, subdivides each [[Array]] element into integer digits and is not a [[Comparison Sorting]] [[algorithm]].

### Overview of [[Fast Sorting Algorithm]]'s in C++
- A [[Fast Sorting Algorithm]] is a [[Sorting]] [[algorithm]] that has an average [[runtime]] complexity of O$(N log N)$ or better. The table below shows average runtime complexities for several [[Sorting]] [[algorithm]]s.

## Best and worst case [[runtime]] complexity
- A [[Fast Sorting Algorithm]]'s best or worst case [[runtime]] complexity may differ from the average [[runtime]] complexity. 
- Ex: The best and average case [[runtime]] complexity for [[Quick Sort]] is O$(N log N)$, but the worst case is O$(N^2)$.

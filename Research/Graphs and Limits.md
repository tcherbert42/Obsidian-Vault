# [[Graphs]] and [[Limits]]

Ex: Julia's sushi and salad buffet costs $10 per pound, but if you get exactly one pound, your meal is free. Let $y=f(x)$ represent the price of your lunch in dollars as a function of its weight $x$ in pounds. 

- Write an equation $y=f(x)$ as [[Piecewise]] defined function. 
>$\quad\quad f(x) =$ { 0 if x = 1
>                  {10x if x $\neq$ 1

- Draw a graph of $y=f(x)$.

- Describe the behavior of $f(x)$ when $x$ is near 1 but not equal to 1 (approaching 1). 
  $\quad\lim\quad f(x) = 10$                                as $x\rightarrow1,\quad f(x)\rightarrow10$
$\quad{x}\rightarrow1$
>[!hint] $f(1) = 0$ -- notice the [[Limit]] $x\rightarrow1 : (f(x)=10)$ is not equal to $f(1)$

Definition. For real numbers $a$ and $L$, the $\lim f(x) = L$ means:
                                                                  $x\rightarrow a$
                                                                
- $\quad f(x)$ gets arbitrarily close to $L$ as $x$ gets arbitrarily close to $a$ .

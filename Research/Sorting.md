# [[Sorting]]
- [[Sorting]] is the process of converting a list of elements into ascending (or descending) order. For example, given a [[List]] of numbers (17, 3, 44, 6, 9), the [[List]] after [[Sorting]] is (3, 6, 9, 17, 44).
- The challenge of [[Sorting]] is that a program can't "see" the entire [[List]] to know where to move an element. Instead, a program is limited to simpler steps, typically observing or swapping just two elements at a time. So [[Sorting]] just by swapping values is an important part of [[Sorting]] algorithms.
